# Power Analysis of Female Murder Victims' Relationship to Offenders

This analysis uses FBI data reported by local law enforcement agencies to perform a power analysis of female victims' relationship to their offenders.  This group project allowed us to better understand the challenges in gathering information about crimes at a national level, as well as to dive into a topic that was interesting and about which we were passionate.  The study was conducted in R, using R Studio, and a Power Point presentation was created for sharing our work, as well as a report that walked through the analysis in a more detailed manner than the R notebook.
